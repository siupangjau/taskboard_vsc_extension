# TaskBoard above is my extension.

What should I update to be outstanding

Okay, great! Knowing that TaskBoard ("BenLe.taskboard") is your extension gives me a much better perspective on how to offer targeted advice. Here are some suggestions for updates to make TaskBoard outstanding, focusing on features, usability, performance, and marketing:

**I. Core Functionality \& Features**

* **Enhanced Data Persistence/Sync Options:**
    * **Cloud Sync:** Implement optional cloud synchronization (e.g., using GitHub Gists, VS Code Settings Sync, or a service like Dropbox/Google Drive) to allow users to access their boards across multiple machines. *This is a big win for users who use VS Code on multiple devices.*
    * **Multiple File Support:** Allow users to manage tasks across multiple `.taskboard` files within a workspace. This would enable project-specific boards.
* **Advanced Task Features:**
    * **Subtasks/Checklists:** Enable the creation of subtasks or checklists within a task card.
    * **Due Dates/Reminders:** Integrate due dates and, ideally, some form of system notification (even if it's just a VS Code notification) for approaching deadlines.
    * **Priorities:** Add a priority level (High, Medium, Low) to tasks for better visual prioritization.
    * **Tags/Labels:** Allow users to tag tasks for filtering and categorization.
* **Improved Editor Integration:**
    * **Task Links to Code:** Allow users to link tasks directly to specific lines of code within their project. Clicking the link in the task would jump to that line in the editor.
    * **Automatic Task Creation from Comments:** Implement a feature to automatically create tasks from specially formatted comments in the code (e.g., `// TODO: [TaskBoard] Refactor this function`).

**II. Usability \& User Experience**

* **Improved Visual Design/Theming:**
    * **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the board (colors, fonts, card styles).
    * **Dark Mode Support:** Ensure excellent dark mode compatibility.
* **Drag-and-Drop Enhancements:**
    * **Drag-and-Drop from Editor:** Allow users to drag and drop code snippets directly onto a task card to create a link or add it as a description.
    * **Visual Drag-and-Drop Feedback:** Improve the visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations (e.g., clear highlighting of the target column).
* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the entire board is fully navigable using the keyboard for accessibility and power users.
* **Context Menu Options:** Add more options to the right-click context menu for tasks and columns (e.g., "Edit," "Delete," "Duplicate," "Move to...").

**III. Performance \& Stability**

* **Optimize Rendering:** Ensure smooth scrolling and fast rendering, especially with large boards.
* **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing to catch and fix bugs.
* **Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages to the user when something goes wrong.

**IV. Marketing \& Community**

* **High-Quality Documentation:** Create detailed documentation explaining all features and how to use them.
* **Showcase/Example Boards:** Provide example `.taskboard` files to help users get started.
* **Promotional Video/GIF:** Create a short video or GIF demonstrating the key features of the extension.
* **Community Engagement:** Actively respond to user feedback, feature requests, and bug reports. Consider creating a GitHub Discussions forum or a Discord server for your extension.
* **VS Code Marketplace Optimization:**
    * **High-Quality Icon:** Make sure your extension icon is visually appealing and professional.
    * **Detailed Description:** Clearly describe the features and benefits of your extension.
    * **Keywords:** Use relevant keywords in your extension description to improve search ranking.
* **Blog Posts/Tutorials:** Write blog posts or create tutorials on how to use TaskBoard for different workflows.

**Prioritization:**

If I were you, I'd prioritize these initial updates:

1. **Cloud Sync (GitHub Gists or VS Code Settings Sync):** This is a highly sought-after feature.
2. **Subtasks/Checklists:** Adds a lot of value to task organization.
3. **Due Dates:** Basic but critical for task management.
4. **Keyboard Navigation:** Improves accessibility and appeals to power users.
5. **Improved Documentation:** Makes the extension easier to learn and use.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly enhance TaskBoard and make it a truly outstanding task management solution for VS Code. Good luck! Let me know if you have any more questions.
